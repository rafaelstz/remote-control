## How it works
Remote Control is based on [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets), so you may have a good and modern browser, like Firefox, Chrome or Opera.

The phone send a message through WebSockets to the server.
The server receive the message as an action that must be executed, like 'next' or 'previous'.
This action are emited to the HTML5 presentation.

## Dependencies
* [nodejs](http://nodejs.org)
* [socket.io](http://socket.io)
* A modern Web Browser with WebSockets support in your desktop [can i use websockets?](http://caniuse.com/#search=websockets)
* A modern Web Browser with WebSockets support in your phone [can i use websockets?](http://caniuse.com/#search=websockets)

## How to install
For while, you need to install manually :(

First, if you don't have node, you must to install. Google it, if you don't know how.
Install socket.io:
```cli
npm install socket.io
```

## How to use
Run app.js:
```cli
node app.js
```
The server will be available at port 81 [http:localhost:81](http:localhost:81), but you can change if you want.

Now, you need to add 2 JavaScript libraries to your HTML5 presentation:
```html
<script src="http://localhost:81/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/remote-control.js"></script>
```

You're almost ready to start the presentation!
Add this code to your presentation file:
```javascript
var remote = new RemoteControl();
remote.connect('http://localhost:81');
remote.on('next', function() {
	// Your method to move to the next slide
});

remote.on('previous', function() {
	// Your method to move to the previous slide
});
```
Now point your phone browser to your IP address on port 81.
You must see a ugly(i'm working on that) page with 3 buttons.
If everything is ok, now you are able to control your HTML5 presentation with your phone.
